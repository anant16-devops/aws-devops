# This is a basic Nginx configuration file that listens on port 80
# and proxies requests to a backend server running on port 8000.
# It sets the Host header to the original host and includes the client's
# real IP address in the request headers.
# Make sure to adjust the proxy_pass URL to match your backend server's address.
# Save this file as nginx.conf and place it in the appropriate Nginx configuration directory.
# To apply the configuration, restart Nginx with the command:
# sudo systemctl restart nginx
# Ensure that Nginx is installed and running on your server.
# You can test the configuration with:
# sudo nginx -t
# This will check for syntax errors in the configuration file.
# If there are no errors, you can proceed to restart Nginx.
# For more advanced configurations, refer to the Nginx documentation.
# https://nginx.org/en/docs/
# This configuration is suitable for simple web applications or APIs.
# For production use, consider adding SSL/TLS support and other security measures.
# You can also customize the location blocks to handle different routes or static files.
# Remember to monitor your Nginx logs for any issues or errors.
# Access logs can be found in /var/log/nginx/access.log
# Error logs can be found in /var/log/nginx/error.log
# Adjust the log paths in the Nginx configuration if necessary.
# This configuration is a starting point and can be expanded based on your application's needs.
# For example, you can add caching, load balancing, or custom error pages.
# Always back up your configuration files before making changes.
# If you need to serve static files directly from Nginx, you can add another location
# block like this:
# location /static/ {
#     root /path/to/static/files;
# }
# This will serve files from the specified directory when requests are made to /static/.
# Make sure to adjust the path to your static files accordingly.
# You can also enable gzip compression for better performance:
# gzip on;
# gzip_types text/plain text/css application/json application/javascript text/xml application/xml application/xml+rss
# application/font-woff2;
# gzip_min_length 1000;
